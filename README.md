# simpliplay-freebsd
A port of SimpliPlay to FreeBSD. Its files won't be updated to accomodate to the latest version of SimpliPlay, but you can follow the README.txt guide inside the usr/local/share folder on how to update.

Compatible with FreeBSD 13 and newer.

**The source code for this version is in the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/A-Star100/simpliplay-desktop/) and is exactly the same as the main desktop version**
**This repository is only a direct download repository for the FreeBSD version, as we don't want it interfering with the main repository's downloads as it may confuse users.**
**Thanks for understanding.**
